# Temperature-forecasting-for-Toronto
Deep learning is very useful in handling mass data. LSTM is a specialized RNN architecture which has been designed to deal with information over many time steps. LSTM has a long-term memory component, memory cell (c) copied from time step to time step. So that LSTM is a good way to analyze the trend of weather and forecast future weather. 
This project will use Keras based on TensorFlow to create LSTM model to predict the temperature of Toronto in next 30 days and display the graph with matplotlib. This project is a simple practice of using deep learning method in data handling.
